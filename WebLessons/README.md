## [Lession 1 : HTML (2024.12.13)](#list)

- My sister suddenly wanted to learn Web Programming. Fortunately, she had a wonderful brother.
- I instructed her to first save a file with a `.html` extension in *Windows Notepad*, containing the minimal structure of an HTML document. Then, double-click to open it in a browser, and primarily modify the content within the `<body>` tag. By refreshing the browser, she could observe the changes and learn the basic functions.
- I also taught her how to generate code using LLMs.
- When I asked when she wanted to learn, her proactive attitude was impressive as she requested immediate remote instruction.
